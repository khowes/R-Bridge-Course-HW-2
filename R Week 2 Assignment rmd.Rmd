## "n choose r"

In probability, "n choose r" means n! / (( n - r)! * r!).   For example, "5 choose 3" evaluates to 10.
R has built in functions for choose() and factorial(). The objective of this assignment is to write a variation of the choose() function that does not use either of these functions.

```{r }

n = 4
r = 2
d = n - r

x <- 1
for (i in 1:n) {x <- x * i}
x

y <- 1
for (i in 1:r) {y <- y * i}
y


z <- 1
for (i in 1:d) {z <- z * i}
z

x / (z * y)

```
